This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## libraries used in project are

1. Rxjs
2. Ngrx
3. bootstrap

## Reason to use rxjs

Rxjs is used to improve response time and reduce code redunduncy and to reduce the chances of data lickage. I have implemented the observables and behavior subject to maintain response and used pip operator and map function to bind the data between observables.

## Reason to use ngrx

Used ngrx to make code work smoother and looks good.

## Reason to use bootstrap

Used bootstrap to make web page look nice, as no need to create initial styling and i can use bootstrap classes easily.
